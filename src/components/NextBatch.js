            <h3>BEFORE YOU ORDER, I have two requests. First, I want you to bring out your inner food critic and give me feedback on the sauces. Improvement comes through feedback I would love to hear yours. Second, to try and cut down on waste if you can return your bottles once they are empty I would appreciate it, plus it keeps costs down so I can keep making sauces for you lovely people. Want to help? Consider leaving a tip through the link above to support the next round.</h3>
